-----
by [Filip Klubička](https://github.com/GreenParachute/mqm-eng-cro) and Yuying Ye



CONTENTS
------
- **csv** annotated .csv file exported from translate5.
- **MQM_IAA_scripts** Python scripts to conduct the statistical analysis on MQM. output. The script **main.py** runs all the analysis.
- **202004232204** output of the analysis on two NMT systems.
-**extra_sys** additional annotation of the third NMT system, the code adjusted for analysing this single output and the result.
